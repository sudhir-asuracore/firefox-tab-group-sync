- **Where it is stored**: Data is stored locally on your machine and synced across your devices using your Firefox Account's cloud storage.
- **Third-Parties**: No data is ever sent to any third-party servers or developers. All your information remains within your personal Mozilla-managed cloud environment.

## Permissions

The extension requires the following permissions to function:
